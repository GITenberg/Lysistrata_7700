description: 'Aristophanes'' play, Lysistrata, takes place toward the end of the Peloponnesian
  War and centers on the lives of the soldiers'' wives. One woman, Lysistrata, under
  the impression that a man''s libido is ultimately his driving force in life, comes
  up with an interesting peace solution: to deny their husbands sexual relations until
  they can settle on a peace agreement that will end the war. However, Lysistrata''s
  strategy effectively creates even more war than before as the sexes begin to feud
  with each other. Aristophanes'' play is both comic and poignant as it reveals the
  relationship between men a.'
